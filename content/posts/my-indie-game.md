Since I was a kid one of my dreams was making a videogame, today my dream is becoming true with "Rosa", a game about a deep dive inside the mind of Rosa, the protagonist, a girl haunted by her past. 

I'm co-developing the game with my fella Fulviix, you can [find us on X](https://x.com/PF_GamesStudio).

More infos are coming soon, for now I'm attaching a first look at the game assets (Be aware that we are not artists).
